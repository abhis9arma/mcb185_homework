Sliding Window Algorithm

Calculating GC content over a length of values
Then slide the window
like taking the average in a series, and then moving the window

overlapping vs. non overlapping windows
Non-Overlapping
	Looks like translation
	Transfer of nucleotides to amino acids
Overlapping
	GC composition and skew
